# Celebrity Face Recognition WebApp
![index](index.gif)<br/>
In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people. In this model firstly we collected images of the athletes from the internet and then cropped all the face detected in images using OpenCV. Then we Wavelets transformed the images to extract the key feature of the faces. Then we created a training set to train the data. We tried many algorithms but chose SVM as it was giving the best results. Then we created a flask application as a backend to handle the input and return output.
